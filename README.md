This is a Trading indicator, built to identify zones of Liquidity (Grab or Sweep)
This indicator helps traders identify and visualize areas on a price chart where liquidity is likely being accumulated or targeted by institutional traders. These zones often coincide with large buy or sell orders, making them critical for anticipating potential market reversals or strong price movements. The indicator features two main zones: an upper liquidity zone (red line) plotted above recent swing highs and a lower liquidity zone (green line) plotted below recent swing lows. When the price enters these zones, it signals that buy-side or sell-side liquidity has been taken out, suggesting a possible reversal or continuation depending on price action.

Understanding how to use liquidity zones can significantly enhance trading strategies. Institutional and large traders frequently push prices into these zones to trigger stop-loss orders and create the liquidity needed for substantial positions. When this happens, observing price behavior is essential. If the price breaks into a liquidity zone and then quickly reverses, it often signals that liquidity has been absorbed and the market might move in the opposite direction. To strengthen this signal, traders should use confirmation tools like candlestick patterns or additional indicators. In trending markets, the sweep of a liquidity zone might indicate a trend continuation rather than a reversal.

The script also includes background highlighting in orange when a liquidity grab occurs, marking areas where significant liquidity events take place. Traders should monitor these highlights closely, paying attention to price behavior and volume. A strong rejection with high volume after a liquidity grab could signal a market reversal. Additionally, the indicator features an alert system that notifies traders when a liquidity grab occurs, which is useful for those who cannot monitor the charts continuously. These alerts help traders analyze market conditions and decide on potential trades.

Different trading strategies can benefit from this indicator. In counter-trend trading, if a liquidity sweep occurs and the price shows a strong rejection, a trader might consider a reversal trade. However, it is important to use proper risk management, as counter-trend trades carry more risk. For trend-following strategies, liquidity zones may act as points of continuation in strong trends. For instance, in an uptrend, if the lower liquidity zone is swept without a reversal, it could be a signal to go long in line with the trend. Understanding liquidity zones also aids in strategic stop-loss and take-profit placement, helping traders avoid premature stops and optimize profit targets.

Combining this indicator with other tools can enhance its effectiveness. Volume analysis can add significance to liquidity sweeps, indicating institutional activity. Identifying support and resistance levels can provide additional confluence, as these levels often align with liquidity zones. Furthermore, observing candlestick patterns, like pin bars or engulfing candles around liquidity zones, can help confirm entry and exit points, giving traders a well-rounded approach to market analysis.
